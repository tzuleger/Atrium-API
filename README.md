This library provides API functionality for a User to interact with a CDVI Atrium Controller using the Atrium SDK as provided by CDVI (https://mrdltd.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/PUB/overview?homepageId=32014396)

The goal of the outcome of this library is to have simple functionality for any User to download the Library and interact with a controller via Code or for any User to learn how the SDK works at a deeper level.
